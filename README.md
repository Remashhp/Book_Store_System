# Book_store_system
In this project, I used concepts from the Vanilla JavaScript 101 course to create a simplified book store system. It includes features like searching for books, viewing books, selling books, and removing books from the library. Working on this was enjoyable, and I am excited to tackle more complex JavaScript projects in the future.
